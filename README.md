# Seattle-AirPollution-analysis-for-pollution-control-using-Apache-Hive

In this project there are two sample datasets for Seattle air pollution (Seattle_data and Seattle_Data), with which we did analysis on that data and those queries can be accessed from Seattle_AirPollution_dataset_analysis file. This file includes both queries and outputs after execution of those queries. For installation process, we need to have Java firstly followed by Hadoop and then Hive for proper execution.
